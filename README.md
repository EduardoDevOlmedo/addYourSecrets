# Easy React Pack (ERP)

This is made for those who are learning react and are tired of doing create-react-app and having to delete those unused files.

Hope this saves some time for those that are trying to do fast tests or learning react.

### THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR DEVELOPING REAL PROJECTS, IN THAT CASE, USE 

```npx create-react-app```

## Installation
```git clone https://github.com/EduardoDevOlmedo/REACT-EASY-TO-GET-REPO```

```cd REACT-EASY-TO-GET-REPO/```

```npm i```

```npm start```

Done!
